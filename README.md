### What is a database?

![database](https://github.com/sandeepzgk/jsonschema-serverless-crud/assets/68529032/00880d7a-1d78-4e60-ad03-9d00cd206f2b)

A database is like a digital storage system that helps you organize and manage information in a structured way. It's similar to a virtual filing cabinet where you can store and access various types of data, such as names, numbers, dates, and more. Instead of scattering your information across different files or papers, a database brings everything together in one central place, making it easier to find and manage your data.

Think of a database as a convenient and efficient way to store and retrieve information. It allows you to organize data into categories and subcategories, enabling quick searches and sorting based on specific criteria. With a database, you can easily keep track of your records, find information when you need it, and perform calculations or analysis on your data without the hassle of manual organization or complicated spreadsheets.

### What is auditing?

![auditing](https://github.com/sandeepzgk/jsonschema-serverless-crud/assets/68529032/a8a4e5b8-1a46-4a4c-b061-36a966b0cd9f)

Auditing refers to the systematic examination and evaluation of records, accounts, processes, and activities within an organization. It involves reviewing and assessing various aspects to ensure compliance, accuracy, and reliability of financial, operational, or procedural information. The primary purpose of auditing is to provide independent and objective assurance to stakeholders, such as shareholders, investors, and regulatory bodies, that the organization's operations and financial reporting are in accordance with established standards, laws, and regulations.

Auditing involves gathering evidence, analyzing data, and assessing internal controls to determine the validity and integrity of information. It includes verifying financial transactions, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of processes, and identifying areas of risk or improvement. Auditing can be conducted by internal auditors within the organization or by external auditors who are independent and separate from the entity being audited. The findings and recommendations of audits play a crucial role in enhancing transparency, accountability, and trust in organizations and their operations.

### What is an auditable database?

![research](https://github.com/sandeepzgk/jsonschema-serverless-crud/assets/68529032/8cd71bd0-9ed3-4aa6-95ad-c117b8f4d578)

An auditable database, or a database with an audit trail, is a database that tracks and records all changes made to the data. It maintains a chronological history of modifications, enabling transparency, accountability, and the ability to perform audits. This feature helps detect errors, prevent fraud, and investigate unauthorized activities within the database.

By keeping a comprehensive record of actions such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, an auditable database provides a transparent and reliable source of information. It allows for tracing back the history of changes, identifying who made them, and when they occurred. This level of accountability enhances data integrity, regulatory compliance, and instills confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the stored data.

### What is a JSON Schema?

![jsonschema](https://github.com/sandeepzgk/jsonschema-serverless-crud/assets/68529032/6ba8ce62-d9b1-46df-8761-c25fc0cdfa06)

A JSON Schema is a way to define and describe the structure and validation rules for data represented in JSON format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format used to store and exchange data on the web. Think of a JSON Schema as a blueprint or a set of guidelines that helps ensure the data you receive or create in JSON format meets specific requirements.

JSON Schemas provide a standardized way to define the expected structure, data types, and constraints for different properties within a JSON object. It helps validate and enforce rules such as required fields, allowed values, and data formats. By using a JSON Schema, you can ensure that the data you send or receive adheres to a consistent structure, making it easier to work with and minimizing errors or inconsistencies.
